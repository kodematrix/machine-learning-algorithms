NB: Predicting Delayed Flights

Predicting flight delays can be useful to a variety of organizations. Here,
we look at five predictors. The outcome of interest is whether or not the flight is delayed (delayed here means
arrived more than 15 minutes late). Our data consist of all flights from the Washington, DC area into the New York City area during January 2004. A record is a particular flight. The percentage of delayed flights among these 2201 flights
is 19.5%. The data were obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (available on the web at www.transtats.bts.gov). The goal is to accurately predict whether or not a new flight (not in this dataset), will be delayed. The outcome variable is whether the flight was delayed, and thus it has two classes (1 = delayed
and 0 = on time).

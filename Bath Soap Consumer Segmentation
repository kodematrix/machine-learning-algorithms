Segmenting Consumers of Bath Soap

Business Situation
CRISA is an Asian market research agency that specializes in tracking consumer purchase behavior in
consumer goods (both durable and nondurable). In one major research project, CRISA tracks numerous
consumer product categories (e.g., “detergents”), and, within each category, perhaps dozens of brands. To
track purchase behavior, CRISA constituted household panels in over 100 cities and towns in India, covering
most of the Indian urban market. The households were carefully selected using stratified sampling to ensure a
representative sample; a subset of 600 records is analyzed here. The strata were defined on the basis of
socioeconomic status and the market (a collection of cities).
CRISA has both transaction data (each row is a transaction) and household data (each row is a household),
and for the household data it maintains the following information:
● Demographics of the households (updated annually)
● Possession of durable goods (car, washing machine, etc., updated annually; an “affluence index” is
computed from this information)
● Purchase data of product categories and brands (updated monthly)
CRISA has two categories of clients: (1) advertising agencies that subscribe to the database services, obtain
updated data every month, and use the data to advise their clients on advertising and promotion strategies; (2)
consumer goods manufacturers, which monitor their market share using the CRISA database.
